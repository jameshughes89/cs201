Lab #1
******

* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab
* I will not be helping people setup IntelliJ on their laptops
* Ensure I have recorded your completion. Failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective
